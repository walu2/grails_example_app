TekDays with Grails 3.0

This is the companion sample application for [Grails 2: A Quick-Start Guide] the book *unsurprisingly* focuses on Grails 2 and the examples reflect that.

This project is the Grails 3.0 version of the sample application. It was only as I was working through *Chapter 6 - Getting Things Done* and in particular the *Integration Testing* section that the differences between Grails 2 and 3 became disruptive. So after much problem solving and learning this version now runs the application and passes all the tests.

The hope is that this project will provide quicker/easier answers to anyone trying to learn with the TekDays sample application on Grails 3.0
